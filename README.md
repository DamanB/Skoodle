# Skoodle
An online solution designed to streamline the attendance taking process for schools 

## Development Scope
Skoodle was developed with the purpose of being a prototype for the attendance taking solution. This project was developed as part of a university course project. 

## Implementation Decisions
As Skoodle is a prototype, no database or hosting system is used for this application. Instead, initial data is loaded on application boot and is transferred throughout web pages using the browser's local storage. 

## How to run Skoodle
To run Skoodle, simply deploy the index.html file on a local host. (I.e. using live server plugin on VS Code)
